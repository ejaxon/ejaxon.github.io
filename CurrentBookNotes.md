## Healing the Heart of Democracy

5 habits of the heart
Deliberate, not accidental citizens.
Toqueville

Loom of Democracy chapter

Most interesting bit here is the idea that founders set up a system where we can never shut any question down forever. p. 74, plus "debate sustained over time ..." on p. 81

In "Life in the company of strangers" chapter:
- I don't like his coopting of "political" to mean only the corridors of power vs "public". It makes the political evil and hopeless, which doesn't need to be true.

Creating public spaces overdone a bit, but good stuff there. Importance of public spaces where we encounter the other - no argument.

p. 162 Workplace ... that touches the idea that how we operate in our small spaces (work) is eventually reflected in the larger political world.

Powerful group techniques
164: Highland School
166 Public Narrative & Hillel & Obama camps


It's about the inner work needed to fully engage the outer work of democracy, the 5 'habits of the heart': (1) We must understand that we are all in this together. (2) We must develop an appreciation of the value of 'otherness'.

(3) We must cultivate the ability to hold tension in life-giving ways. (4) We must generate a sense of personal voice and agency. (5) We must strengthen our capacity to create community.

Palmer talks about places these habits can be cultivated and describes valuable examples like the Highland Folk School and Obama camps. 

I had trouble w/ a couple points. He distinguishes politics from public life, ceding politics to the zero-sum gamers. Words matter & I believe we must reclaim politics for all of us.

He also describes movements as starting from a 'Rosa Parks moment' of decision. To me that plays into a hero narrative that can paralyze us. But the book is a good reminder that who we are impacts what kind of democracy we can achieve.

As a final note, I'm particularly grateful to the book for reintroducing me to ideas from de Toqueville's Democracy in America. I read it years ago, but will begin rereading it forthwith. /end




## Congress' Constitution

Josh makes the normative claim that powers not only do depend on politics, but that they should (latest e.g., last paragraph on p. 129).

"Ecology of transparency", p. 222. Congress + press + civil society

"real legislative authority is, in fact, largely constructed through the processes of public engagement" p. 229

As much about HOW those powers can be used effectively as about what the powers are.
