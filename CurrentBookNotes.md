Deliberate, not accidental citizens.

Loom of Democracy chapter

Most interesting bit here is the idea that founders set up a system where we can never shut any question down forever. p. 74, plus "debate sustained over time ..." on p. 81

## Congress' Constitution

Josh makes the normative claim that powers not only do depend on politics, but that they should (latest e.g., last paragraph on p. 129).

"Ecology of transparency", p. 222. Congress + press + civil society

"real legislative authority is, in fact, largely constructed through the processes of public engagement" p. 229

As much about HOW those powers can be used effectively as about what the powers are.
