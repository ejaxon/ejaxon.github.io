Loom of Democracy chapter

Most interesting bit here is the idea that founders set up a system where we can never shut any question down forever. p. 74, plus "debate sustained over time ..." on p. 81

In "Life in the company of strangers" chapter:
- I don't like his coopting of "political" to mean only the corridors of power vs "public". It makes the political evil and hopeless, which doesn't need to be true.

Creating public spaces overdone a bit, but good stuff there. Importance of public spaces where we encounter the other - no argument.

p. 162 Workplace ... that touches the idea that how we operate in our small spaces (work) is eventually reflected in the larger political world.

## Congress' Constitution

Josh makes the normative claim that powers not only do depend on politics, but that they should (latest e.g., last paragraph on p. 129).

"Ecology of transparency", p. 222. Congress + press + civil society

"real legislative authority is, in fact, largely constructed through the processes of public engagement" p. 229

As much about HOW those powers can be used effectively as about what the powers are.
