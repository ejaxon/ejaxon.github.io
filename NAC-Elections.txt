Hey, all, 

Just want to announce that elections for the Code for America Brigades National Advisory Council are going to be held from this Monday, January 29 through Friday, February 9. All Code for Asheville members* are invited to participate.

These are the folks who represent you and Code for Asheville to the national Code for America organization and to other brigades, so please use your voice and vote! 

The candidates will be announced Monday - I will post that announcement here, together with a link to the candidate guide and ballot. Monday night at 8 PM EST there will be a Candidate Forum where you will have an opportunity to talk with the candidates and ask them questions. The event will be recorded - I will include links to that and to vote in the newsletter this week as well as here. If you would like to participate in the live forum, you can RSVP here: https://codeforamerica.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_XBK6uv4kQm6sr4IpYT3bsw?mc_cid=794adc5e5f&mc_eid=abb91ea83b.

You'll be voting for one regional (Southern) and five at-large representatives.
