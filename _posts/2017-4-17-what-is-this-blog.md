title: What is this blog?
---

I spent most of my days down in the dirt of data and systems in City government and I love it. At the same time, the whole reason I'm here is that I'm interested in how we improve our democracy, make our communities work better, and almost everything I do in the dirt is, or should be, connected back to that. And the best two ways I know to constantly reconnect to purpose are (1) staying in conversation with people who care about what I care about, but have different perspectives and (2) remembering to ask questions.

I try to participate in conversation as much as possible, both within my local community and in the broader community of those doing government, civic tech, political work, etc.

But I think that the conversation can even usefully include conversation with myself. That's essentially what this blog is, an attempt to carry on a conversation with myself. I will be thrilled if it also engages others, but I believe it's helpful even if I'm talking to myself.
