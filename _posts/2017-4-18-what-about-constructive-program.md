title: What's all this about Gandhi and constructive program?
---

It started one day a couple months ago. I was in a dark place, feeling anxious and depressed about what was happening on the national political scene, but also feeling guilty about everything I _wasn't_ doing about it. I believe the work I'm doing is important and it takes pretty much all the energy I have, but at the same time every call to Congress I hadn't made, every protest I hadn't attended, every donation I withheld weighed on me.

I brought this up at a session that day with my spiritual director. I expected Dan to say something supportive, of course, along the lines that each of us has only so much energy, that we have to let ourselves off the hook for not doing everything, to focus on what we can do. But that's not exactly what he said.

What he said was that it would be a _tragedy_ for me to spend time calling Congress or marching in protest. Not because making those calls or hitting the streets are not good or important things to do - they are.  But doing them would take me away from the work that only I can do. Important as they are, they aren't _mine_.

Then he told me that he's been excited from the beginning about the work I've undertaken through Code for Asheville, DemocracyApps, and now through my job at the City of Asheville, that he sees the work I do as what Gandhi termed "constructive program".

So that led me to investigate just what the constructive program is and how it applies or doesn't to my work and that of civic tech generally.

## Constructive Program vs Nonviolent Resistance

Gandhi is known, correctly, for his pioneering use of non-violent resistance as a mechanism of social and political change. But Gandhi himself talked throughout his life, and increasingly toward its end, about a vital complementary component of non-violence that he called _constructive program_. Where non-violent resistance is designed to break down the system of oppression, constructive program is the vital process of building something better to replace it. In the concrete case of the fight for self-rule in India, Gandhi argued that failing to do the constructive part would lead to the British regime being simply replaced by an Indian version of the same thing (and he would probably argue that that is largely how it turned out). Constructive program is essentially a program for building capacity for democracy.

In the decades since Gandhi's assassination there has been tremendous ongoing work on non-violence as a mechanism for social and political change. Non-violence has been shown by researchers like Gene Sharp not just to work, but often to be more effective than violent resistance in a wide range of circumstances. There were significant successes in the Nordic countries and even in Germany during WWII and a veritable explosion of successes in 1989 and the years since, partly through the dissemination of how-to manuals like Sharp's _From Dictatorship to Democracy_. As Dan pointed out in a recent presentation, non-violence as a strategy has been so successful that a recent Nicholas Kristof column in the New York Times refers to Sharp simply as "THE expert on challenging authoritarians."

The constructive program has, in contrast, been largely neglected. It is usually mentioned in books on Gandhi and on non-violence, but generally as a side note rather than as central theme. In fact, in _How Nonviolent Struggle Works_, Gene Sharp notes that:

>> Advocates of the use of nonviolent action in place of techniques of violence have sometimes argued that the results achieved by nonviolent action are likely to be more permanent and satisfactory than those achieved by violence.
>
> Those advocates have argued that in the period following a successful nonviolent struggle, there will likely be "no aftermath of resentment, bitterness or revenge, no necessity for further threats of force," as Richard Gregg put it. A lasting change in the power relationships between the contending groups is also likely.

In effect, the constructive program is reduced to a simple assumption that the use of non-violent means to force change will somehow automatically result in a transformation of society.

On the one hand it seems reasonable to assume that the aftermath of change brought about by non-violent means is likely to be better than that following violent ones. On the other hand, the assumption of transformation is in direct contradiction to Gandhi's assertion that the resisters are likely to simply become the new oppressors within an essentially unchanged system.

I would argue that those familiar with issues of organizational change would probably have to side with Gandhi. The underlying structures and dynamics of an organizational system are remarkably persistent, often surviving even wholesale replacement of most of the participants. And a system at the scale of an entire nation is unlikely to be less resistant to change.







The thing is, I am not particularly interested in overthrowing systems. First, the systems I'm interested in - the United States and tens of thousands of local communities that make it up - I don't think overthrow is the answer, I think transformation is. Better to look at the resistance as the early stages of what should be a long-term transformation

In some ways I suspect that our national politics may be the result of reducing our political discussion to winning the election, to winning power. It might not have involved the kinds of weapons that shed blood, but our approach to politics would certain qualify as violent in Gandhi's terms.

I don't think it works, simply kicking the bums out in order to bring our own better brand of bum in. I think we need to figure out how to achieve a deeper transformation, one that leads to real democracy, which I don't think we have today, not meaningfully for everyone. 

I want to be clear that when I say "real democracy" I don't mean more direct participation. Perhaps more direct participation is part of the answer, perhaps not - that remains to be seen. What I do mean is that we have a decision-making process in our communities and in our country that better represents all of our people, that is able to deal with national and international issues in all their true complexity.

I think that means undertaking an ongoing effort of evolution that can only take place in our local communities. It can't be done at the national level.  I suspect that the national level is inevitably a reflection of the quality of our local democracies. 

So back to Gandhi and the constructive program. Why haven't we ever heard of it? I suspect part of the reason is that while Gandhi referred to it over and over, he focused always on the concrete things that it involved in his place and time and more than anything else emphasize aspects unlikely to attract enthusiasm, things like: prohibition, personal celibacy, spinning of thread and the use of locally-made cloth, use of provincial languages, integration of untouchables. What have these to do with the problems in Yugoslavia in the 90s or Arab countries a few years ago? Nothing, seemingly.

But after reading through a lot of Gandhi's essays, it's clear that he's coming to his specific, tactical decisions from a place of principle. I'm not sure he always gets it right, but it's not as trivial as just believing that getting everyone to hand-spin thread for locally-made cloth is going to bring democracy to the world.

I read through Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha) followed by a 2006 dissertation about the constructive program, and then his short book devoted specifically to constructive program. I decided to try to look at the elements of his program ()

Basic principles:

- Non-violence
    - non-coercive. Convert don't coerce

- Character (sometimes called purity)
    - Prohibition
    - Basic education (centered on manual work, so also independence)
    - Adult eduction - basically political
- Independence - sometimes decentralization, local
    - Khadi (economic independence)
    - Locality
    - Provincial language
- Unity (maybe really inclusivity)
    - Untouchability
    - Women
    - Labour
    - Farmers
    - Adivasis (aboriginals?)
    - Students
- Equality (=inclusivity?)

What about lepers? Partly unity, but something else?

Some of what I called character maybe more about building civic capacity

Seeing nonviolence outside of its moral or ethical framework is a good thing. Change brought about by nonviolent means it's better than change brought about with violence. And probably the society is the result after the change or better for having gotten there through nonviolent techniques.

At the same time, I am not interested in overthrow. And I think in some ways or national politics is the result of reducing our political discussion to winning the election to winning power, instead of a process of constant striving to better our society. 

I'm not interested simply in kicking the bastards out in order to bring our own better bastard in. I seek transformation. I want our democracy to be more of a democracy than it is today. And I think that means undertaking an ongoing effort of evolution, they can only take place in our local communities. It can't be done at the national level.  I suspect that The national level is inevitably a reflection of the quality of our local democracies. 

Nonviolent protest and resistance is intended to lead to change. But the change sought is just a point in a process . Better to look at the resistance as the early stages of what should be a long-term transformation

Much of my reading and thinking over the past couple months have centered around Mohandas Gandhi and something he called 'constructive programme'. I thought it might be useful to briefly explain why and what it has to do with my work at the City of Asheville and Code for Asheville.
