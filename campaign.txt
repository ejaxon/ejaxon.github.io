# Win
The #cfabrigade NAC election results are out and I am deeply honored to be one of those chosen. I promise two things. 1/4

First, I take and will continue to take both this movement and this opportunity to serve it very, very seriously. 2/4

Second, I will work to ensure that the NAC communicates regularly and well and operates transparently so that all brigade members have the opportunity to weigh in on the decisions that affect them. 3/4

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the 29 other candidates who ran with me in this election. It was an honor to be counted among you and I look forward to working with all of you going forward. 4/4


# Lose

The #cfabrigade NAC election results are out and I am about equally disappointed and relieved not to have been chosen :). 1/3

I look forward to supporting those who were chosen in the hard work that lies ahead. We are in this together. 2/3

And I want to express my gratitude to the 29 other candidates who ran with me in this election. It was an honor to be counted among you and I look forward to working with all of you going forward. 3/3



# One-liner:

I've come to believe that Code for America brigades have a crucial role to play in changing how we do local govt and democracy generally, but it's not going to happen magically. We're a pretty awesome network now, but we need to turn that network into a real movement. I've got some ideas, but I'd love the opportunity work with other brigade leaders to figure out how to make that happen.

So I've decided to run for an at-large seat on the @codeforamerica brigade National Advisory Council. Here's a short(ish) version of why. 1/12

I believe #cfabrigades can & should play a crucial role in revitalizing local govt and how we do democracy in the 21st century, but it won't happen by magic. 2/12

It requires that we be strategic about transforming the loosely connected network we are today into a real movement. I think that requires we focus on 3 things: 3/12

1. Define the change we're working to bring about. We work locally, but share a vision for our communities. We must clarify and organize around it. 4/12

2. Ensure our work makes a difference. Movements work because they connect shared vision to useful tactics & strategies which all can learn and practice. 5/12

3. Make our work sustainable. Our success won’t come through individual heroics or built-in-a-weekend solutions. We are in this for the long haul. 6/12

Solving these is not a top-down process, but leadership is critical to support the continuous, network-wide conversation we need. Our role as leaders is 7/12

to pay attn to brigades' 100s of experiments, synthesizing & articulating what is learned, and communicating it back out, as an evolving understanding. 8/12

In the next year, this means that we need to build out strong connection and communication processes, as well as create more transparent governance structures. 9/12

I don't claim I know how to do all that :). But I've thought about it all for a while now. I'd love the oppty to work with other #cfabrigade leaders to figure it out. 10/12

NATIONAL SLACK: Hi, all, here's a short version of why I'm running for the NAC. You can find a slightly more complete version in the candidate guide: https://medium.com/code-for-america/meet-the-candidates-for-the-2018-national-advisory-council-baf2ab7bb84e?mc_cid=4feab798b6&mc_eid=abb91ea83b.
