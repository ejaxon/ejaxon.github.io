Ulysses. James Joyce.
The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Malcolm X.
Several books, including my HS Western Civilization textbook. William H. McNeill.
The Elements of Style. William Strunk and E.B. White
The Power Broker. Robert Caro.
Alcoholics Anonymous.
The Bible.
A History of American Law. Lawrence M. Friedman.
The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Thomas S. Kuhn.
