One of the things that I think Gandhi got wrong was to constantly blame failure on the character of the participants, himself even more than his followers. The idea seems to be that perfect democracy requires the development of perfect people.

I don't want to argue that it's not important, even vital to develop the capacity for self-government and that it involves personal emotional and spiritual development. I think that it is. But if we have to wait until we get a large number of such evolved people. even just as leaders,before we can get the kind of society we need, we're doomed.

But I think that's wrong. And a big part of the reason I think it's wrong is that I have participated in an international, highly decentralized organization with astoundingly effective governance that is built on just about the least reliable people in the world: alcoholics.

Idea that AA builds governance on a group of the least reliable people.

Democracy - people don't get principles, won't stay informed, won't think deeply about systems.
