title: What's all this about Gandhi and constructive program?
---

One day a couple months ago I was in a dark place, feeling anxious and depressed by what was happening politically, but also feeling guilty about every call to congress I didn't make and every protest I didn't attend. I had a session that day with my spiritual director. He said something helped me in the moment, but also set me exploring.

He began not by saying that I should forgive myself for the things I wasn't doing but that it would actually be a tragedy if I did them instead of the things that I am doing. He told me that he's been excited by the things I've been doing, with DemocracyApps and more recently working for the City of Asheville. Not that making calls to congresspeople and marching weren't good, important things to do, but that they weren't *mine* to do. A student and teacher of nonviolence,he said that I was working on what Gandhi called "constructive programme", basically building democracy.

Gandhi is known, correctly, for his pioneering use of non-violent resistance as a mechanism of social and political change. But Gandhi himself talked throughout his life and increasingly toward the end of his life of a vital complementary component of non-violence that he termed the constructive program. Where non-violent resistance is designed to break down the system of oppression, the constructive program is the vital process of building something better to replace it. Otherwise, as he said (and indeed as it turned out, he would argue), the British regime would simply be replaced by an Indian version of the same thing.

In the decades since Gandhi's assassination there has been tremendous ongoing work on non-violent means of change and resistance. Non-violence has been shown not just to work, but to be more effective than violent resistance in a wide range of circumstances, by researchers like Gene Sharp. There were significant successes in the Nordic countries and even in Germany during WWII and a veritable explosion of successes in 1989 and the years since, partly through the dissemination of how-to manuals like Sharp's _From Dictatorship to Democracy_. 

There has little if any parallel research or development of his constructive program from a specifically Gandhian perspective. It is generally mentioned in books on Gandhi and on non-violent resistance, but usually as a side note, not something central. In _How Nonviolent Struggle Works_, the "Cliff Notes" version of Sharp's 3-volume work on the politics of non-violence, there is for example a single reference and the period after struggle gets only the following:

    "Advocates of the use of nonviolent action in place of techniques of violence have sometimes argued that the results achieved by nonviolent action are likely to be more permanent and satisfactory than those achieved by violence.

    Those advocates have argued that in the period following a successful nonviolent struggle, there will likely be "no aftermath of resentment, bitterness or revenge, no necessity for further threats of force," as Richard Gregg put it. A lasting change in the power relationships between the contending groups is also likely."

On the one hand it makes perfect sense that books about resistance against oppression spend more energy on the resistance than on what happens after victory is won. But there's a problem - what happens after matters ... a lot. 

Anyone who has paid any attention to the problems of organizational change know that a transformation of organizational culture doesn't happen as the result of a single victory. Culture is tremendously persistent and lives far beyond any particular set of people who make up the organization at a particular time. I remember learning years ago about churches that if you want to understand the core issues in any congregation, look to the issues at its founding, even if that was many generations in the past. It's not that it's impossible to change the culture of an organization or community, but it does mean that it's very, very hard.

If this is true of a church or a corporation, how much more true must it be of an entire nation. I remember the enthusiasm about what might change after the fall of the Berlin wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Look at Russia today. Is it really that different? No. It still has an essentially autocratic system. Many of its basic characteristics have survived the fall of the monarchy and the later fall of the communist regime. 

I do believe that change brought about by nonviolent means is better than change brought about with violence. I suspect that the society that results afterward is probably better than could have been achieved through violent overthrow. But I have my doubts how transformational the change will end up being without much more work.

The thing is, I am not particularly interested in overthrowing systems. First, the systems I'm interested in - the United States and tens of thousands of local communities that make it up - I don't think overthrow is the answer, I think transformation is. Better to look at the resistance as the early stages of what should be a long-term transformation

In some ways I suspect that our national politics may be the result of reducing our political discussion to winning the election, to winning power. It might not have involved the kinds of weapons that shed blood, but our approach to politics would certain qualify as violent in Gandhi's terms.

I don't think it works, simply kicking the bums out in order to bring our own better brand of bum in. I think we need to figure out how to achieve a deeper transformation, one that leads to real democracy, which I don't think we have today, not meaningfully for everyone. 

I want to be clear that when I say "real democracy" I don't mean more direct participation. Perhaps more direct participation is part of the answer, perhaps not - that remains to be seen. What I do mean is that we have a decision-making process in our communities and in our country that better represents all of our people, that is able to deal with national and international issues in all their true complexity.

I think that means undertaking an ongoing effort of evolution that can only take place in our local communities. It can't be done at the national level.  I suspect that the national level is inevitably a reflection of the quality of our local democracies. 

So back to Gandhi and the constructive program. Why haven't we ever heard of it? I suspect part of the reason is that while Gandhi referred to it over and over, he focused always on the concrete things that it involved in his place and time and more than anything else emphasize aspects unlikely to attract enthusiasm, things like: prohibition, personal celibacy, spinning of thread and the use of locally-made cloth, use of provincial languages, integration of untouchables. What have these to do with the problems in Yugoslavia in the 90s or Arab countries a few years ago? Nothing, seemingly.

But after reading through a lot of Gandhi's essays, it's clear that he's coming to his specific, tactical decisions from a place of principle. I'm not sure he always gets it right, but it's not as trivial as just believing that getting everyone to hand-spin thread for locally-made cloth is going to bring democracy to the world.

I read through Non-Violent Resistance (Satyagraha) followed by a 2006 dissertation about the constructive program, and then his short book devoted specifically to constructive program. I decided to try to look at the elements of his program ()

Basic principles:

- Non-violence
    - non-coercive. Convert don't coerce

- Character (sometimes called purity)
    - Prohibition
    - Basic education (centered on manual work, so also independence)
    - Adult eduction - basically political
- Independence - sometimes decentralization, local
    - Khadi (economic independence)
    - Locality
    - Provincial language
- Unity (maybe really inclusivity)
    - Untouchability
    - Women
    - Labour
    - Farmers
    - Adivasis (aboriginals?)
    - Students
- Equality (=inclusivity?)

What about lepers? Partly unity, but something else?

Some of what I called character maybe more about building civic capacity

Seeing nonviolence outside of its moral or ethical framework is a good thing. Change brought about by nonviolent means it's better than change brought about with violence. And probably the society is the result after the change or better for having gotten there through nonviolent techniques.

At the same time, I am not interested in overthrow. And I think in some ways or national politics is the result of reducing our political discussion to winning the election to winning power, instead of a process of constant striving to better our society. 

I'm not interested simply in kicking the bastards out in order to bring our own better bastard in. I seek transformation. I want our democracy to be more of a democracy than it is today. And I think that means undertaking an ongoing effort of evolution, they can only take place in our local communities. It can't be done at the national level.  I suspect that The national level is inevitably a reflection of the quality of our local democracies. 

Nonviolent protest and resistance is intended to lead to change. But the change sought is just a point in a process . Better to look at the resistance as the early stages of what should be a long-term transformation
