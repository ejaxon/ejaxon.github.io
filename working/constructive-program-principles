    - non-coercive. Convert don't coerce

- Character (sometimes called purity)
    - Prohibition
    - Basic education (centered on manual work, so also independence)
    - Adult eduction - basically political
- Independence - sometimes decentralization, local
    - Khadi (economic independence)
    - Locality
    - Provincial language
- Unity (maybe really inclusivity)
    - Untouchability
    - Women
    - Labour
    - Farmers
    - Adivasis (aboriginals?)
