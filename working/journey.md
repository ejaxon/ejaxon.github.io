Let me think a bit about how to write about all this.

And what's the goal?

I am working with a lot of different threads (spinning!), at the City, in my reading, in my conversations with Kathy and Dan, in my work at Code for Asheville, in my following the news ... 

I think there are deeply important ties between all the things. Mostly I come at that intuitively. But I'd like to try to make the connections more explicit. The writing itself may help with that. I also want to get more conversation going with people who are willing to engage at this deeper level. That simply is not going to happen with my colleagues in the City or at CfA. They don't come at the world that way.

So the goal is to tie things together.

Question: how do I deal with referring to things that are happening. Good example right now is the idea of driving everyone to a single channel.

Question: do I want to do essays or just thoughts? Is Medium the right venue? Maybe I do the blog on ejaxon.org and publish the essays on medium (that's probably it).
